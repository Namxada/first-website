            <div class="backstory">
                <h2>Origin Story</h2>
                <p>From the beginning, Cam(Blinx's papa father) knew he wanted a grey/white cat. We found the perfect match on a rehoming website, and immediately reached out to the previous owner.
                    Unfortunately, she had JUST surrendered her cat to the shelter literally the same day. We booked an appointment with the humane society as fast as we could, and headed over the next morning.
                    Thankfully, she hadn't been adopted yet, and we got to spend some time with her to make sure we were a good match. She was clearly scared after having been in the same home for 4 years, and suddenly being transfered over to a new environment surrounded by strangers.
                    Every time someone walked by, she would retreat further into her hiding spot. Surprisingly, though, she warmed up to us quickly, and when people stopped walking around, she would come out of hiding for a few pets. We knew, even before we got there, that we had to take her home, so we adopted her on the spot.
                    She was very brave and adventurous, despite having been moved into 2 different new environments in almost 24 hours, and started exploring immediately. We renamed her to "Blinx" since Blinx the game was Cam's inspiration for getting a grey/white cat to begin with.

            <div class="personality">
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>If there's only one word I could choose to describe Blinx, it would be "loud." She doesn't meow so much as she screams, and that's just how she communicates. In the mornings, she'll come up to us and yell in greeting. At nights, she'll perch by her food 3 hours before feeding time, and yell.
                    When she wants pets, she will stare at you, yell, flop, and continue to yell. It took a while to get used to it, but now we've accepted that she is just a natural born yapper.
                    She's fairly lazy, not terribly food motivated, but loves to cuddle. She wants to be where her humans are, and loves to lay on her dad's chest, or in the most inconvenient place by her mom's legs.

            <div class="toys">
                <h2>Favorite Toys</h2>
                <p>
                    Like every other cat owner, we bought Blinx a TON of toys. And like every other cat, she does not play with them. Instead, her favorite toy is a zip tie her mom accidentally dropped on the ground one day.
                    She also really enjoys playing with her nail clipping harness which now serves no practical purpose.
